          Few novels have celebrated researchers, inventors, those who
          observed the world through a microscope. And when they
          appeared, it was often as assistants, or wives of.
          Yet, reality was quite different: they existed, they created, they
          discovered but their story was simply not told.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, <strong>literature</strong> is beginning to repair this silence. Female authors
          bring back to life these forgotten figures, reinvent science heroines, and
          remind us that curiosity, reason and passion have never belonged to a single
          gender.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing about these women is therefore more than a literary gesture: it is a <strong>justice
          done to memory</strong>, a way to finally say their names those that had been
          erased from textbooks as from libraries.

            The book tells the true story of three African-American women: Katherine
            Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, who worked for
            <strong>NASA</strong> in the <strong>1950s-60s</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, the United States was still living under <strong>racial segregation</strong>, and these
            women had to fight twice as hard as women, then as Black women.
          </p>
          <p>
            They were "human calculators": their job was to perform complex
            calculations by hand, so that rockets and astronauts could
            take off and especially return alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite their major contributions to American space successes, their names
            were <strong>erased</strong> from history for decades.
