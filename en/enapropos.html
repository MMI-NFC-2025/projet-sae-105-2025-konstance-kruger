        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="about-section">
          <p>
            My name is <strong>Konstance KRUGER</strong>, I am 19 years old and I am
            studying in my first year of the <strong>BUT MMI</strong> program in
            Montbéliard.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Creativity -->
        <div class="about-section">
          <p>
            You could say I am creative; I like exploring everything related to
            <strong>visual creation</strong> and originality.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Dance -->
        <div class="about-section">
          <p>
            Since I was a child, <strong>dance</strong> has been part of my life,
            whether it is modern jazz, contemporary, break, classical and more.
            I have always loved combining it with my creativity, especially when
            I reached high school. During those years I found a new hobby:
            <strong>freely creating scenarios</strong>, setting up projects about
            topics or feelings that inspire me, and editing videos in a very
            free way, sometimes to tell myself a story.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- YouTube -->
        <div class="about-section">
          <p>
            After spending years watching <strong>YouTube</strong> videos for
            hours, I decided to create my own because I increasingly felt it was
            something meant for me. It became a way to do what I love through
            video editing. I try to keep that <strong>positive energy</strong>
            that editing gives me in everything I do.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- United States -->
        <div class="about-section">
          <p>
            Last year, I had the chance to travel for three weeks to the
            <strong>United States</strong>. This experience opened my mind and
            made me want to discover even more of the world and new
            possibilities. For now, I do not know exactly what I want to do
            later, but I know I want to create, express myself and inspire
            others.
          </p>

        <!-- School project -->
        <div class="about-section">
          <p>
            I created this website as part of a <strong>school project</strong>.
            But I also want to raise awareness about the struggles faced by
            women in fields that were originally considered to be “reserved” for
            men, especially in science. Many women have been discriminated
            against in the scientific world, which is not normal. That is why,
            through this site, I want to both inform and entertain, speaking
            about this topic in a fluid and engaging way, with a design that can
            encourage young people to read and learn more about it.
