          <p class="bio-profession">Afro-American chemist</p>

            Known for developing one of the<br />

      <!-- Her Theory -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h3>HER THEORY</h3>
        <p>
          During her studies at the University of Hawaii, Alice Ball became passionate about
          <strong>chemistry</strong> and was particularly interested in the structure of kava.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then that Dr. Harry T. Hollmann, assistant surgeon at
          Kalihi Hospital, called on her. He was looking to isolate the active principle of
          chaulmoogra oil, which was used at the time in the treatment of
          <strong>leprosy</strong>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- The Problem -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h1>THE PROBLEM?</h1>
        <p>
          This oil has a particularly bitter taste and powerful side effects,
          which discouraged more than one patient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice Ball then developed a revolutionary process: she
          managed to isolate the <strong>ethyl esters of the fatty acids</strong> from the oil,
          making them injectable and therefore much more effective and
          tolerable. Unfortunately, she died before being able to publish her
          results.

      <!-- Its Popularization -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h3>ITS<br />POPULARIZATION</h3>
        <p>
          After her disappearance, Arthur L. Dean (another chemist from the university)
          continued her work and launched large-scale production of the
          treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>1918</strong>, a Hawaiian doctor reported in the "Journal of the
          American Medical Association" that 78 patients were able to leave Kalihi Hospital
          after receiving these injections, a real turning point in
          the fight against leprosy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice Ball is considered an <strong>emblematic example</strong> of the Matilda effect...
          Matilda because of the way her work was minimized and
          attributed to a man after her death, despite its scientific
          importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decades later, researchers rediscovered her work and
          restored the truth, <strong>recognizing</strong> finally that Alice Ball was the
          true inventor of the process.
